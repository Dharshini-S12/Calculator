# Calculator
Hello all,
      I have implemented the simple calculator using HTML, CSS and simple JS concepts. Inside the body the form tag has been used where the input tag has given. Inside the input tag the text field and button field has been used. Onclick function has been implemented with (.value) and for evaluating the final answer the eval() method has been used.
